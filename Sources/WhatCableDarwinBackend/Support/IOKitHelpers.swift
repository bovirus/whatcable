/// registry changed under us mid-read, e.g. a cable was unplugged while we
/// were iterating).
///
/// `IOIteratorIsValid` returning false is ambiguous on its own: Apple
/// documents it as "the iterator is no longer valid", but it is also what a
/// perfectly normal empty match reports (measured directly on macOS 26 by
/// `probes/test-kit/42_typec_phy_subtree.c`: an iterator that matched
/// nothing at all reports invalid too). So invalidity is only treated as a
/// signal worth retrying on when this pass actually produced at least one
/// item; `sawAny` is what tells the two cases apart.
///
/// On a retry, `IOIteratorReset` rewinds the iterator back to the start of
/// its list, so anything this pass already collected would be seen again
/// and double counted if it were kept. The whole pass's results are
/// discarded and the walk restarts from scratch. `transform` is called once
/// per item and the item is released immediately afterwards, whether or not
/// this pass ends up being the one that gets kept, so a discarded pass never
/// leaks the objects it obtained.
///
/// Retries are capped at `maxAttempts` (default 3, i.e. up to 2 resets).
/// After the final attempt this returns whatever that attempt collected
/// even if the iterator is still reporting invalid: an occasionally
/// incomplete result is acceptable here, an unbounded retry loop is not.
///
/// `onTerminalInvalidation` fires at most once, only when the very last
/// attempt still saw the iterator invalidated mid-walk (i.e. the same
/// condition that would otherwise trigger one more retry, but the retry
/// budget is spent). It is a no-op by default so the 30+ existing call
/// sites that only want the collected array are unaffected. For a
/// notification-backed iterator (one obtained from
/// `IOServiceAddMatchingNotification`), this is the caller's only signal
/// that the notification may not have been fully re-armed for future
/// deliveries; see `wcDrainIterator`'s doc comment for what "may" means
