/// Accumulates live SMC DC-in (voltage, current) pairs for the charging-path
/// resistance regression, with per-path reset, transient rejection and the
/// estimate itself (charging-path resistance rework, 2026-08).
///
/// The regression fits `V = a + b*I` over the samples and reports
/// `-b * 1000` as milliohms: the slope of the Mac-side DC-in voltage against
/// current is the negative of the whole charging-path resistance (cable
/// VBUS+GND loop + connectors + charger output impedance + Mac board path).
/// The fitted intercept absorbs the charger's fixed setpoint, so no absolute
/// voltage reference is needed. This replaced the `PowerOutDetails` feed,
/// which the corpus proved never produced a single accepted sample (see
/// `research/cable-resistance-via-iokit.md`).
///
/// This is a pure value type (no IOKit, no @MainActor) so it is
/// unit-testable with synthetic sample sequences and the captured fixture.
///
/// ## Per-path reset
/// The caller resolves a `ChargingInputResolver.Fingerprint` each tick (port +
/// contract identity). When it changes, or resolves to nil, the sample buffer
/// clears and a settle countdown starts, covering cable swap, charger swap,
/// port change and PD renegotiation.
///
/// ## Transient rejection
/// The first `settleSkipCount` ticks after a fingerprint change are
/// discarded. At a 1 s poll rate this gives a ~5 s settle window covering the
/// PD renegotiation handshake. The countdown ticks on every call regardless
/// of whether a usable sample arrives, so the window is wall-clock based.
///
/// ## Distinct-tuple rule (owner criterion)
/// The SMC publishes at roughly 1 Hz while the service may poll faster, so
/// consecutive reads can return the identical (volts, amps, watts) tuple.
/// Identical readings add no regression information and must not advance
/// convergence: a tick whose tuple equals the previously accepted one is
/// dropped.
