    // true` with both SOP1 keys (266, every one read VID 0x05AC / PID
    // 0x7800 at that time -- a dated observation, not an invariant this
    // code enforces), and `Active == true` without the keys (1, an
    // outlier). USB-C StateCC blocks (3342 in the same sweep) never
    // candidate and never emit.
