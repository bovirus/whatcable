/// issue #181 selector migration, step two of two (step one:
/// `planning/dar-50-usb3-speed-corroboration.md`, "Characterisation tests,
/// two committed steps"). Step one committed this file recording each
/// surface's PRE-migration selection for a fixture with BOTH a tunnelled
/// and a direct USB3 transport canonically matching the same port, in both
/// array orders. This commit is step two: it deliberately updates those
/// same test bodies to the POST-migration (`USB3SpeedCorroboration`)
/// selection, so the before/after delta lives in this file's git history as
/// a checked artifact, per the spec.
///
/// Pre-migration finding (unchanged from step one, kept for context):
///
/// - `PortSummary` and `JSONFormatter` did NOT exclude tunnelled entries.
///   Their selection was ARRAY-ORDER DEPENDENT: whichever candidate was
///   first in the array won, tunnelled or not.
/// - `DataLinkDiagnostic` already filtered `tunnelled != true` before
///   selecting, so its selection was already order-independent for this
///   fixture and already preferred the direct entry.
///
/// Post-migration reality (this commit): all three now go through
/// `USB3SpeedCorroboration.selectedTransport`, which excludes tunnelled
/// entries unconditionally, so all three are now order-independent and
/// agree with each other. BUT the `device()` fixture below is not actually
/// a root SuperSpeed device (its locationID has zero non-zero hub-path
/// nibbles, not the one `USBDevice.isRootDevice` requires -- kept
/// unchanged from step one rather than quietly "fixed", since fixing it
/// would have changed the fixture step one already pinned) and neither
/// transport is TRM-restricted, so NEITHER arm of
/// `USB3SpeedCorroboration.isCorroborated` fires. The issue #181 corroboration
/// gate (landing in this same commit) therefore suppresses the speed label
/// on ALL FOUR of the original tests below, regardless of array order: the
/// selector fix and the corroboration gate compound here. The dedicated
/// "corroborated" tests further down isolate the selector fix alone, using
/// a TRM-restricted transport (which corroborates on its own, independent
/// of any device) so order-independence is visible on a label that
/// actually renders.
